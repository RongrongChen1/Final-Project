In addtion, I have a strong interest in Python.


What's more? I have lots of hobby:

* Reading
+ Swimming
- Listening to music

In today's presentation I have submitted "Final_Project.ipynb", "Final-Project.py", "US_category_id.json" and "USvideos.csv"
 Here are the questions , and also the answer we get:
1.For managers, what are the values of these collected data？
For instance, for the first three category showed in x-axis, 'music','entertainment','how to&style', managers could advertise 50%, 40% and 10% of the video to reap the greatest benefits. Of course, you can use more accurate proportion if you want.  |  
The second question is:
2.For video bloggers, what are the values of these collected data？
The data let them know audience's taste and then improve their videos
as a reference, they could find useful ways to broaden video‘s fields or achieve the transition to new area.
